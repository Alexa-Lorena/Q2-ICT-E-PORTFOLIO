<h3> A. About Me </h3>
<img class="intro" src="ME.jpg" alt="A drawing of me, drawn by me.">
<p> Hello! It's Alexa. I think I'll make this introduction short to save time, and since I've already introduced myself, let's just do a quick run-through, 'kay?
<br> <br>
I'm 14 years old, and I just had my birthday on November 6. I'm going on strong. These few months have been rough, to say the least, but I'm glad I'm still here! I have a happy family of five: Mama, Papa, Iyah, Ate Jenny, and Me. I'm a Christian, meaning I believe in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and I am charged with spreading his word through love, life, and peace. </p>

<br> <br>

<img class="intro2" src="FANDOM COLLAGE.png" alt="RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH I love my fandoms!!">
<p> Usually, I don't talk about my hyperfixations, but consider this an exception. I absolutely adore object shows and mascot horror. For some odd reason, I find these highly expressive little guys quite appealing.  For the past month, I've been extensively overanalyzing their dynamics across multiple different fandoms, which include but are not limited to Dandy's World, Battle for Dream Island: The Power of Two, and Inanimate Insanity Seasons 2 & 3. If you ask me what my favorite ship is, it's FanTube. No questions asked. 
<br> <br>
That being said, I find myself struggling with my writing sidequests. Due to...things happening this past month, my upload schedule has been seriously held back into a hiatus, something I didn't anticipate when I started. I've been pressuring myself to get my W.I.Ps done, but if there's one thing I've learned, it's that there are some burdens I don't have to carry. I'll try to ease myself back into the flow soon.
</p>

<br> <br>

<img class="intro" src="EPORT.png" alt="My Q1 E-Portfolio.">
<p> Okay, enough about me and my rambling. You might be asking, what's the sudden switch with the E-Portfolio? Well, this time, this E-Portfolio is going to be less labor-intensive, unlike the last quarter. This E-Portfolio is meant to be simple, just to showcase the CSS application at best, so you, and the rest of the audience, can easily scroll through it. It also includes a LOT more content, which makes it easier for me to edit everything in the final run. With that out of the way, I present the Q2 ICT E-Portfolio! </p>

<h3> E. Reflection </h3>

<p> Despite my expectations from the last two grades, I've eased into CSS just fine. Even when I was first introduced to HTML, I was always under the impression that CSS was this complicated coding language that only the super techy people (like my former classmates, Heiden and Eon) could use and comprehend. Now that I have a solid understanding of how it works, it has become quite convenient when making my web pages. I don't have to make hundreds of inline CSS codes to make my web look appealing anymore!

<br> <br>

That said, I still have a lot to learn regarding CSS, but this time, I'm not pressuring myself to learn as quickly as my former classmates. We all learn at different paces, and as long as I understand what I'm doing, I can go as fast—or slow—as I need. As for now though, I'm content with my skills, and I'm excited to learn more next quarter. Who knows? Maybe next time you see my web pages, they'll have Javascript or Python in them! </p>
